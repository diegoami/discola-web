name: review-handoff
description: Write the prompt the owner gives an independent reviewer (another model, in a tool the owner picks) so it reviews the repository at a milestone and records the result on GitHub. Use when a design proposal is written, when a reviewable PR is ready to merge, or when a release is staged (the milestones in CLAUDE.md), and whenever the owner asks for a review prompt. Also use when the owner says a review is in, to process it.

# Review handoff

First check the milestone is one: `CLAUDE.md` says which PRs are reviewable.
A docs correction or a typo fix is not. Do not write a prompt for it; say it
was verified without a review and why.

Claude implements; another model reviews. The owner picks the reviewer and
its tool (Codex, DeepSeek, or anything else that can run `gh`), so the prompt
never assumes one: no tool-specific commands, and the reviewer signs with its
own tool and model. At each milestone, give the owner one prompt, ready to
paste, in a single fenced `text` block with nothing else in it. Tell the owner
to run it in a **fresh session**, re-reviews included: a reused session
carries its earlier conclusions. The reviewer starts with no context and posts
its results to GitHub itself, so the prompt has to carry everything it needs.

The review is offered, never waited on. Do not stop work for it: set the PR
body's `Review:` line to `not run`, and update it when a verdict arrives
(`AGREE at <sha>`, or `BLOCK at <sha>: #n, #m`).

Some tools load `AGENTS.md` (Codex and OpenCode do), which describes the
OpenCode roles; the note at the top of `AGENTS.md` and the first line of the
prompt tell the reviewer that a handoff prompt makes it the reviewer instead.
Every `gh` call needs network access, which some tools sandbox by default:
tell the owner to allow it.

## Fill in before writing

- **Repo**: `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq .nameWithOwner`.
- **Milestone and thread**: design (the proposal issue), PR (the PR), or release
  (the `release/X.Y.Z` PR).
- **Head SHA**: `git rev-parse HEAD` on the branch under review, pushed. A
  review of a stale head wastes a round. For a PR already merged, the merge
  commit, and the review reads `git diff <sha>^1 <sha>`.
- **What changed and why**: two or three sentences. Do not argue for the change.
- **Claims to verify**: the specific things the work says are true, with
  `file:line`. These are what the reviewer checks hardest.
- **Checks already run**: each command, its pass *count*, and what it would
  have caught. The reviewer should aim at what those checks cannot see.
- **Known owner decisions**: questions already put to the owner, so the
  reviewer does not report them as defects.
- **Labels**: `gh label list`. Make sure `review` exists
  (`gh label create review --description "Found by an independent review"`).

## Template

```text
You are the independent reviewer for <owner/repo>, working from a
review-handoff prompt: this prompt, not the OpenCode roles in AGENTS.md or any
other agent-instructions file your tool loads, defines your job. Claude did
this work, not you. Do not trust its description. Verify everything against
the code.

MILESTONE: <design proposal | pull request | staged release>
THREAD: <issue or PR URL>
HEAD: <branch> at <sha>. Check out that SHA before you start, and stop and say
so if you cannot.

WHAT CHANGED: <two or three sentences>

CLAIMS TO VERIFY:
- <claim> (<file:line>)

ALREADY RUN: <command: pass count, what it would catch>. Look for what these
cannot see.

KNOWN OWNER DECISIONS (not defects): <list, or "none">

Read the repository's CLAUDE.md first: its principles and rules are the
standard. Review <the proposal | the diff against main | the merged diff,
git diff <sha>^1 <sha> | the release PR and the staged checksums in its body>,
and follow it into any file it touches or relies on. Problems elsewhere in the repository count too, as out of scope.

Rules:
- Do not edit files, commit or push. Your only writes are the GitHub issues
  and the one comment described below, made with the gh CLI.
- Reproduce every finding: cite file:line, and give the command, the input or
  the reasoning that shows it. Leave out anything you could not reproduce.
- Do not report style preferences.
- Before opening an issue, search open issues (gh issue list --search) and
  comment on an existing one instead of duplicating it.

1. For each finding, open one issue:
   gh issue create --label review --label <bug|robustness|tests|design|cleanup|documentation>
   Title: the defect, stated plainly.
   Body:
     - Severity: MUST-FIX (a defect this change introduces or fails to
       resolve, that should be fixed before merging), SHOULD, or OUT OF
       SCOPE (not caused by this change)
     - Found by: review of <THREAD> at <sha>
     - What: the defect, with file:line and a reproduction
     - Why it matters: what a user or maintainer would notice
     - Suggested fix: the smallest change that resolves it
     - Effort: S, M or L
     - Signed: — Reviewer (<tool>, <model>)

2. Then, always, even if you found nothing, post one comment on THREAD:
   VERDICT: AGREE | BLOCK        (BLOCK if any MUST-FIX issue was opened)
   Reviewed: <sha>
   Issues opened: #n (MUST-FIX), #m (SHOULD), ... or "none"
   Owner decisions: questions only the owner can settle, or "none"
   Nits: one line each, or "none" (nits do not get issues)
   Checked and clean: what you verified and found correct
   — Reviewer (<tool>, <model>)
```

## When the owner says the review is in

- Read the verdict comment on the thread and every issue it lists
  (`gh issue view <n>`), and update the PR body's `Review:` line. Note whether
  the SHA it names is the current head or an earlier one.
- Reproduce each finding yourself before acting on it. A reviewer can be wrong,
  and so can you.
- MUST-FIX and SHOULD: fix it, with `Fixes #n` in the PR, or rebut it with
  evidence in a comment on the issue and leave the close to the owner. If the
  PR is already merged, the fix is a new PR. Recommend which fixes belong
  before the merge; the owner decides. OUT OF
  SCOPE: leave the issue for its own change. Owner decisions: put them to the
  owner with a recommended default. Nits: your call, and say which you took.
- Reply on the thread with what happened to each finding.
- Rerun the gates after any fix. Offer a re-review prompt only when a
  MUST-FIX was fixed by a change that is itself reviewable; it runs only if the
  owner wants it.
